### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luke. I'm seed-stage an investor docused on developer tools and computing infrastructure. I split my time between investing & writing code whenever I can. If you'd like to chat, feel free to [email me](mailto:luke@tapestry.vc) or book some time to chat [here](https://calendly.com/byrnemluke).

- Working at TBC - investing and building internal tools.
- Thinking about the Verticalization of Cloud Infrastructure, Edge Computing, [WebAssembly](https://byrnemluke.com/posts/webassembly), and Low Code.
- Writing code (more soon).
