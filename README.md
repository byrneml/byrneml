### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luke. I'm an investor at [Amaranthine](https://amaranthine.com), where I focus on developer tools, enterprise and infrastructure at pre-seed, Seed, and occasionally Series A. I split my time between investing & writing code for internal tools, and write a lot of code in my free time. If you'd like to chat, feel free to [email me](mailto:luke@amaranthine.com) or book some time to chat [here](https://calendly.com/byrneml).

- ðŸ”­ Working at [Amaranthine](https://amaranthine.com) - investing and building internal tools, building [Packages](https://packages.so) in my free time. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all about [WebAssembly](https://github.com/byrneml/wasm-projects), [Low Code Tools](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uq0QudL8nQTVKt1r2PdS0Yzkn9VzDpx02J_UInj2idE/edit?usp=sharing), and the future of how we write code.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to speak with anyone thinking about the above areas, or generally thinking about starting a company.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with mapping out all the companies building tools for and around WebAssembly. If you know of any, please send them my way or add them [here](https://github.com/byrneml/wasm-projects)
